Class of 2020 at Appalachain State University for a Bachelor of Mathematics with a concentration in Statistics. 

Growing up, math was something I always did well in. Not to the caliber of prodigy, I still had to work for the concepts and I still miss to carry the negative in calculations. What really got me were the math teachers and professors throughout my education. The degree of passion and effort put forth in creating challenges to overcome. The solutions are mostly objective but the pathways required my thinking to be more flexible. 

Statistic takes things even further, where things aren't always so clearcut. Each step in the process requires us to doubt and verify our underlying assumptions. How can I make sense of the world that's around me? Are we sure we're seeing whats actually going on? Going towards the future, the amount of data available to us only gets larger and larger. Its answers waiting to be discovered.
