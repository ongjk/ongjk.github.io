	abstract = {Applied Linear Statistical Models", 5e, is the long established leading authoritative text and reference on statistical modeling. For students in most any discipline where statistical analysis or interpretation is used, ALSM serves as the standard work. The text includes brief introductory and review material, and then proceeds through regression and modeling for the first half, and through ANOVA and Experimental Design in the second half. All topics are presented in a precise and clear style supported with solved examples, numbered formulae, graphic illustrations, and "Notes" to provide depth and statistical accuracy and precision. Applications used within the text and the hallmark problems, exercises, and projects are drawn from virtually all disciplines and fields providing motivation for students in virtually any college. The Fifth edition provides an increased use of computing and graphical analysis throughout, without sacrificing concepts or rigor. In general, the 5e uses larger data sets in examples and exercises, and where methods can be automated within software without loss of understanding, it is so done.},
